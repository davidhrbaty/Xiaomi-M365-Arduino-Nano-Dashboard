# Xiaomi M365 Display 
# Products Used  
Arduino Nano    
I2C OLED 0.96" Screen     
3d Printed Bracket  
1N4148 Diode  
0.25w 120ohm Resistor       

Estimated Price: $20-40 depending on whether or not you're using a clone Arduino

# Flashing  
Install the libraries provided in the files, install them to your 
arduino libary folder, usually C:\Users\%username%\Documents\Arduino\libraries.
I used Arduino 1.6.6, but newer versions should work.  Will not work with 
Arduino versions prior to 1.4.3.  In the libraries folder, you should have
a "SSD1306Ascii-master" folder with files inside after unzipping.

Arduino must be run at least once to generate the "Arduino" folder inside
of "Documents."

# Physical Connections

4.7k ohm pull-up resistors, from the +5v to the SDA/SCL lines, may also be used to prevent occasional screen freezing.

# Known Issues  
Sometimes, especially on hard braking, the Arduino freezes.  I am unsure of how
to fix this, and the reset button does not fix it.  I recommend installing a NC 
button to reset the Arduino on the +5V line, or simply stopping the scooter
and restarting it.

# 3D Printed Case
An updated 3D printed case that fits the nano is available here, on thingiverse:

Print in PETG or ABS for heat resistance.  PLA goes too soft in the summer.
Glues such as E6000 are required for installation.
